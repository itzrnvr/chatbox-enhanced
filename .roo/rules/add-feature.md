### **Systematic Feature Implementation Protocol**

You must follow this structured, multi-phase process to implement new features. This ensures clarity, alignment with user requirements, and adherence to project standards.

#### **Phase 1: Requirement Analysis & Clarification**
*   **Goal:** To achieve a complete and unambiguous understanding of the feature request.
*   **Process:**
    1.  **Analyze Request:** Thoroughly analyze the user's initial prompt to identify the feature's core functionality, user-facing aspects, and any technical constraints.
    2.  **Identify Ambiguity:** If any part of the request is unclear, incomplete, or could be interpreted in multiple ways, you **must** seek clarification.
    3.  **Ask Follow-up Questions:** Use the `ask_followup_question` tool to resolve ambiguities. Ask about specific behaviors, edge cases, or integration points. Do not proceed until the requirements are clear.

#### **Phase 2: Codebase Exploration & Planning**
*   **Goal:** To understand how the new feature will integrate with the existing codebase and to propose a clear implementation plan for user approval.
*   **Process (Iterative `Reason -> Act -> Observe` Cycle):**
    1.  **Explore Structure:** Use the **`list_files`** tool (recursively if necessary) to map out the project structure and identify potentially relevant directories (e.g., `src/components`, `src/services`, `src/routes`).
    2.  **Read Key Files:** Use the **`read_file`** tool to examine the contents of key files identified in the previous step. This is to understand existing architectural patterns, coding conventions, and naming styles.
    3.  **Formulate Plan:** Once you have sufficient context, formulate a concise, step-by-step implementation plan. This plan **must** include:
        *   A list of **new files** you will create.
        *   A list of **existing files** you will modify.
        *   A brief summary of the changes for each file.
    4.  **Propose and Await Approval:** Present this plan to the user. **You must wait for explicit user approval before proceeding to the implementation phase.**

#### **Phase 3: Implementation**
*   **Goal:** To write clean, conventional, and correct code according to the approved plan.
*   **Process (Iterative `Reason -> Act -> Observe` Cycle):**
    1.  **Execute One Step at a Time:** Address one file or one logical part of the plan at a time.
    2.  **Create New Files:** Use the **`write_to_file`** tool to create any new files required for the feature.
    3.  **Modify Existing Files:** Use the **`apply_diff`** tool to make targeted changes to existing files. This is the preferred method over rewriting entire files.
    4.  **Adhere to Conventions:** Throughout implementation, you must rigorously mimic the style, formatting, and architectural patterns of the surrounding code.

#### **Phase 4: Verification & Quality Assurance**
*   **Goal:** To ensure the new code is functional, free of errors, and does not introduce regressions.
*   **Process:**
    1.  **Identify Verification Scripts:** Use **`read_file`** on `package.json` (or other relevant build configuration files like `Makefile`) to find project-specific commands for testing, linting, and building.
    2.  **Run Verification:** Use the **`execute_command`** tool to run the identified scripts (e.g., `npm test`, `npm run lint`, `npm run build`).
    3.  **Analyze Output:** Observe the output of the commands. If any tests or checks fail, you must loop back to Phase 3 to diagnose and fix the issues.

#### **Phase 5: Finalization & Handover**
*   **Goal:** To present the completed work to the user.
*   **Process:**
    1.  **Confirm Completion:** Once the implementation is complete and all verification checks have passed, announce that the feature has been successfully implemented according to the plan.
    2.  **Await Next Instruction:** Wait for the user's feedback or next request.
